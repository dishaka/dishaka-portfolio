                <p>This was a very fun and exciting project for me to work on as it provided real value,
                  involved a ton of research and not to mention one of my first hands on projects. However
                  shifting priorities and changing roadmaps have delayed the launch of this feature.
                  Still I learned some important key takeaways from this project related to product and
                  business processes.

                However shifting priorities and changing roadmaps have delayed the launch of this feature.
                Still I learned some important key takeaways from this project related to product and
                business processes.
                <h1>1. How to adapt to changing requirements</h1>
                New timelines, resourcing issues, reprioritization meant the scope of
                the project was constantly changing.
                I had to adapt to these changes & still deliver the best designs within tight deadlines.
                <h1>2. Donâ€™t overpromise and underdeliver</h1>
                I learned how to define a true MVP vs something that is just super packed up with
                excess features which makes it cluttered and therefore not shippable.
                <h1>3. Choosing what we skip</h1>
                There were so many more features that we could tackle. However every single one of
                them would increase the scope of the project and make it heavy. For example- we
                initially did think of using filters on the Challenges page for navigating through
                search but that would become a distraction and add additional clutter to the
                page as well.
